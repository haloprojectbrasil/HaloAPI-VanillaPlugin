# HaloAPI

HaloAPI it's a [Vanilla Forums](http://vanillaforums.org/) plugin, developed to help forum managers to connect users accounts to their Halo 5 stats, using the [Halo 5 Public API](https://developer.haloapi.com). This plugin uses the [PHP-HaloAPI class](https://github.com/haloprojectbrasil/PHP-HaloAPI), developed first by the GitHub user [GRosay](https://github.com/GRosay).

This plugin was first developed to the [Halo Project Brasil's forum](http://forum.haloprojectbrasil.com.br), which uses Vanilla Forums system.

## Usage

Wait for the launch of the very first version :P

## CHANGELOG

## TODO

- Series of private methods which will get needed data from the PHP-HaloAPI class, like service records, etc;
- Series of public methods which will get those data from the private ones and output it in some cool way into vanilla forum (like emblem at the forum's avatar, etc);
- Administration interface for customization of something like an ACL (Access Control List) configuration, and to decide what is being used from that list;
- Series of private methods which will write on the DB important information about the plugin configuration, like the api key;
